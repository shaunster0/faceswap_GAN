# FaceSwap GAN

This project implements a simplified version of the GHOST face-swapping model using PyTorch. It leverages an identity encoder (ArcFace), an attribute encoder (U-Net-based), and a generator with Adaptive Attention Denormalization (AAD) blocks to produce high-fidelity swapped face images.

## ðŸš€ Features

- U-Net-based attribute encoder with optional skip connections
- Pretrained ArcFace identity encoder
- AAD-based generator (inspired by [GHOST](https://github.com/zyainfal/ghost))
- PatchGAN discriminator
- Supports LFW dataset preprocessing with face alignment
- Modular training pipeline with Weights & Biases integration
- Identity & reconstruction losses to preserve realism
