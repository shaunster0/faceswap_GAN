# FaceSwap GAN

This project implements a face-swapping model using PyTorch. It leverages an identity encoder (ArcFace), an attribute encoder (U-Net-based), and a generator with Adaptive Attention Denormalization (AAD) blocks to produce high-fidelity swapped face images.

Training is currently occuring on WANDB at https://wandb.ai/shaunwerkhoven-i/faceswap_GAN
